# fotmob-scraper
- Created a FotMob scraper to reconstruct Fantasy Football scores by using Google Sheets API for Python
- Scrape data from FotMob and WhoScored to combine all generic Fantasy Football metrics (except for Clean Sheets)
- This is currently semi-automated as you have to manually feed the URL links for the two websites. The goal is to make it so that every Gameweek all the games are scraped automatticaly.
